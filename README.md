What it is?

MacDm is a simple tool for all the Mac Users that play D&amp;D as Dungeon Masters. The tool will help them to keep track of all the NPCs controlled by the DM, keep track of their info and add comments.
It also has a section where you can roll dice from 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 20 and to add modifiers to see the final result.

What it would be?

In further versions the app will consider:
  - Keeping track of turns in combat.
  - Save th PCs of the players and a way to change them easily.
  - An easy create character section, with track of points (the 27 purchase points) and selection of races, class and feats.
  - Name generator for NPCs (directly in the form).
  - Name arrays for certain races (a special button to easy access).
  - Any other idea you could have.
  
How can you help?
  - Any idea you've to improve the app would be apreciated, and if you can do it yourself it would be a nice trick too
  - Proving the app to see if it works also would be a great idea
